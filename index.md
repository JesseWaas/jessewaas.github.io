Welcome to my new website! This incarnation is based on a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/JesseWaas/jessewaas.github.io), and edited via [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/). The current theme is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

> It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a Grue.

This is my latest attempt at creating and maintaining a blog. I hope to document and share some of my adventures on this platform.

**Short term goal:** Configure this theme.

**Long term goals:** Go on amazing trail runs, mountain bike rides, climb mountains, explore caves, and build things. Work less.
